Problem

Editing the website with your voice

Solution

Create a voice recognition app that can edit the markup code

Small project to prove that is possible

Create a simple app that can move the paragraph alignment

from text-align:left to text-align:center to text-align:right just by using your voice.

Examples of input

“Put the paragraph on the left”

“Please align everything to the right”

“I want the paragraph centered”

Detection

“Put the paragraph on the left”

“Please align everything to the right”

“I want the paragraph centered”

Voice input returns string values: ‘paragraph’,’left’,’move’ in unordered list
